          <p>
            The alignment on this facebook login page is simple but it has all
            the items were it's "confortable" for the eye. It seems to has the
            right padding and margin between the components and all is well
            distributed.

          <p>
            The amount of white space in this instagram login page fits the
            necessary space everyone needs when reading something. Also, has a
            clean design that means that all is readable and it does not seem as
            "dirty" to the eyes.

            For this site were chosen an specific combination of colors in the
            range of blue, combined with white creating then a perfect harmony
            between both adding shadows. There were also chosen especific
            combinations for the cards, links, titles and buttons.
