      <h1>Your weather 24</h1>
      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>
        Your weather 24 will impact directly on any kind of people that wanna
        know the time NOW. People who are going to do outdoor activities need to
        know NOW if it is going to rain, or what is going to happen during the
        day. In turn, the people who will go to work must know what the weather
        will be like, to know what they can wear, and how to organize their day.
      </p>

      <h2>Personas</h2>
